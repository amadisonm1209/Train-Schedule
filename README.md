# Train-Schedule

For the Harry Potter fan that should be all of us, I bring you the Hogwarts Express Train Schedule.

Using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Firebase and Moment, this app allows the user to add their own trains to the schedule. Using moment to calculate the difference between times, they will be able to see when the next train comes and can plan accordingly ;) Firebase keeps track of everything added and updates.
